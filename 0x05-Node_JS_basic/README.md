## Project Overview

In this project, you will learn the basics of Node.js, an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. You'll gain an understanding of how to set up a Node.js project, work with its core modules, and build basic applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the purpose and basic functionality of Node.js.
- Set up a Node.js development environment.
- Use Node.js core modules such as `fs`, `http`, and `path`.
- Create and run a basic Node.js application.
- Understand asynchronous programming in Node.js.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: Package manager for JavaScript
- **JavaScript**: Programming language

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (>= 14)
- NPM (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alx-backend-javascript.git
   cd alx-backend-javascript/0x05-Node_JS_basic
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To run the various scripts and examples in this project, use the `node` command followed by the file name. For example:

- Run the main application:

  ```bash
  node app.js
  ```

- Run the file system example:

  ```bash
  node file-system.js
  ```

- Run the HTTP server example:

  ```bash
  node http-server.js
  ```

- Run the asynchronous programming example:

  ```bash
  node async.js
  ```
