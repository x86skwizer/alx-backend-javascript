**Getting Started**

While this repository is archived, you can still use it as a reference for learning backend JavaScript. Here are general steps to follow for each project:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine. If you're unfamiliar with Git, you can find tutorials online.
2. **Set Up Development Environment:**
    * Install Node.js and npm (or yarn) on your system. Refer to the official Node.js website for installation instructions: [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)
    * Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies (recommended): [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
3. **Project-Specific Setup (if applicable):** Some projects might have additional setup instructions within their folders. Refer to their READMEs or comments for details.
4. **Run the Project:**
    * Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
    * Execute any project-specific commands (consult project instructions). Common commands might include `npm install` to install dependencies, or `node index.js` or `yarn start` to run the project.
